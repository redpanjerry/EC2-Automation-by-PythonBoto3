# DevOps Practice (EC2 automation by Boto3)

#### This is a practice exercise
Our main goal in this tutorial is to develop an **automation program** that takes a YAML configuration file as input value and deploys a **Linux AWS EC2 instance** with **two volumes attached** and **two different users**.

(In this tutorial, we are using MacOs for our Operating System, but feel free to use any other OS)

## Prerequisite
- AWS Account
- Access Key & Secret Access Key
- IAM User with role attactched
- EC2 Keypair

## General guidelines to follow:

- Install all required packages inside requirements.txt
- Create **Python3.7 â†‘ virtual environment**. Follow [Virtual Environments and Packages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) if further instruction is needed
- If you are using an existing key, include **key_name** and value in **server** section of confing.yaml.
- You can include subnet and security groups information in config.yaml too.
- Start the application, it'll ask you for AWS credentials. You should specify your own AWS credentials, you can change the region or leave it as default


## Step 1: Change key_name in YAML configuration file

1. The following section is the template of YAML file

```
---
# This YAML configuration specifies a server with two volumes and two users
server:
  server:
  instance_type: t2.micro
  ami_type: amzn2
  architecture: x86_64
  root_device_type: ebs
  virtualization_type: hvm

  ## Change it to your own keypair's name ##
  key_name: 'your_keys_name'
  ## Change it to your own keypair's name ##

  min_count: 1
  max_count: 1
  volumes:
    - device: /dev/xvda
      size_gb: 10
      type: ext4
      mount: /
    - device: /dev/xvdf
      size_gb: 100
      type: xfs
      mount: /data
  users:
    - login: user1
      ssh_key: --user1 ssh public key goes here-- user1@localhost
    - login: user2
      ssh_key: --user2 ssh public key goes here-- user2@localhost
```
2. Make sure to change the **your_keys_name** to your own key's name
    - Example > **key_name: ec2-key-test**
  
## Step 2: Create IAM user and assign required roles to it, also save credentials for further use

1. Login to your AWS account, go to **IAM**

2. On the left panel, go to **Users**, then click **Add user**

3. For User name, enter: **dev-test**
4. For Access type, select **Programmatic access**, then click **Next: Permissions**

<p align = "center">
      <img src = "images/000-create-iam-user.jpg" width = "80%" height = "80%">
      </p>


5. For Set permissions, select **Attach existing policies directly**
6. From Filter policies, seach for the following policies and make sure they are selected, then click **Next: Tags**
   
   - **AmazonEC2FullAccess**
   - **AmazonSSMFullAccess**
  
<p align = "center">
      <img src = "images/001-attach-policies.jpg" width = "80%" height = "80%">
      </p>

7. Click **Next: Review**, then click **Create user**

8. After you click Create user, you will see your **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**, make sure you copied them to your clipboard for further use, or you can just download the .csv file

<p align = "center">
      <img src = "images/002-credentials.jpg" width = "80%" height = "80%">
      </p>

## Step 3: Run app.py to execute the automation program

1. In this tutorial we are going to use **Visual Studio Code** as our IDE, where we install our **Python Virtual Environment**, and where we execute our code

2. On the top panel, go to Terminal, then select **New Terminal**

3. Install **Python Virtual Environment** by running the following command:
   - ``python3 -m venv tutorial-env``
     - On Windows, run: ``tutorial-env\Scripts\activate.bat``
     - On Unix or MacOs, run: ``source tutorial-env/bin/activate``
<p align = "center">
      <img src = "images/003-python-virtual-env.jpg" width = "80%" height = "80%">
      </p>

4. Navigate to the folder to where you save your app.py file by the command ```cd 'file location'```
   - For example, if my app.py file saves at a folder named 'dev_ops' on the desktop:
  
<p align = "center">
      <img src = "images/004-cd-file-location.jpg" width = "80%" height = "80%">
      </p>

5. Run ``python app.py`` to execute app.py, it will ask you to enter your Access key, Secret access key, and specify a region (can leave as default)

<p align = "center">
      <img src = "images/005-enter-credentials.jpg" width = "80%" height = "80%">
      </p>

## Step 3: Connect to your EC2 instnace by 2 different users to check if it can read/ write to volumes

1. Login to your AWS account, go to **EC2**

2. On the left panel, select **Security Groups** then select the **default** security group
3. Click **Edit inbound rules** to add permissions
4. Click **Add rule**, select **SSH** for Type, select ``0.0.0.0/0`` for source, then click **Save rules**
   <p align = "center">
      <img src = "images/006-edit-sg-rules.jpg" width = "80%" height = "80%">
      </p>
5. On the left panel, select **Instances**, you shold see a running instance that just created by app.py

6. You can check the following details, it will be the same as the value that we specified in config.yaml:
   - Instance type
   - AMI
   - key pair name
   - virtualization type
   - Storage: 2 different EBS volumes attached with the size specified
   
7. Make sure to copy the **Public IPv4 address** of the instance to your clipboard for further use

8. Now we are going to connect to the EC2 instance, you can follow this document to connect:
   - [Connect to Your Amazon EC2 Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/vmlaunch/step-2-connect-to-instance.html#sshclient)

9. To connect to your EC2 instances by 2 different users, you can try the following command:
    - ssh -i **'location of your keypair file'** user1@**'Public IPv4 address'**
    - - ssh -i **'location of your keypair file'** user2@**'Public IPv4 address'**
   <p align = "center">
      <img src = "images/007-user1-connect.jpg" width = "80%" height = "80%">
      </p>
    <p align = "center">
      <img src = "images/008-user2-connect.jpg" width = "80%" height = "80%">
      </p>

10. Now we are goint to test the permision of read/ write to EBS volumes, you can either connect by user1 or user2
11. Run ``lsblk`` to list all the volumes, we can see the two volumes that created by app.py with the value specified in config.yaml

12. First, we are going to create an empty .txt file and move it to /data volume to check to write permission
13. Run ``touch hello.txt`` to create a .txt file
14. Run ``vim hello.txt`` to see the content of the .txt file, then run the following command to edit it:
    - Type ``i``, then enter whatever you want in the file
    - Type ``esc`` when you finish editing, then type ``:x`` and ``Enter`` so save and exit
    
15. Now, we are going to move the hellp.txt to one of our volume by runnging ``mv hello.txt /data``
16. We can move our location to /data volume by running ``cd /data``, then we run ``ls`` to see that the hello.txt file is now under the /data volume

17. Redo step 14 to edit hello.txt file
18. If you can successfully read and edit the file, it means that this user has the permission to read/ write in the volume

## Conclusion

The overall workflow is to run app.py to read the configuration in config.yaml, then run the main() function, which calls all the API we wrote in aws_util.py, including:
 - set_client()
 - set_block_device_mapping()
 - set_userdata()
 - get_latest_ami()
 - create_instance()

The output of this automation program are:
- An Linux AWS EC2 instance
- Two volumes attached to the instance
- Two different users which are able to connect and access the instance and volumes

## Clean-up
- EC2 instance
- IAM user
